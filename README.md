configuration
After interfacing camera
1)You can capture an image by just typing a single line command.Open terminal
windows and type the command as follows:
$ sudo raspistill ‚Äìo/home/pi/Desktop/image.jpg
This command will capture an image and store it at the specified location(here the
location specified is /home/pi/Desktop)with the specified name(here the name
is‚Äôimage.jpg‚Äô).
2)You can even write a code In Python to capture an image using a raspberry pi camera.
Connection :

Practical no 6
Aim-linux command:Exploring the raspbian
FILESYSTEM:
LS: The ls command list the content of the current directory(or one that is specified).It can be
used with the ‚Äìl flag to display additional information(permissions,owner,group,size,date and
timestamp of last edit) about each file and directory in a list format.The‚Äìa flag allows you to
view files beginning with.(i.edotfiles)
CD: Using cd changes the current directory to the one specified.You can use
relative(i.ecddirectoryA) or absolute(i.ecd/home/pi/directoryA) paths.
PWD: The pwd command displays the name of the present working directory:on a Raspbian Pi,
entering pwd will output somthing like /home/pi.
MKDIR: You can use mkdir to create a new directory,e.g. mkdirnewDir would create the
directory newDir in the present working directory.
RMDIR: To remove empty directories,usermdir.So,forexample,rmdiroldDir will remove the
directory oldDir only if it is empty
CAT: You can use cat to list contents of files(s),e.gcatthisFile will display the content of
thisFile.Can be used to list the contents of multiple files,i.ecat*.txt will list the contents of all .txt
files in the current directory
HEAD: The headcommand displays the beginning of a file. Can be used with ‚Äìn to specify the
number of lines to show (by default ten), or with ‚Äìc to specify the number of bytes
TAIL: The opposite of head, tail displays the end of a file. The starting point in the file can be
specified either through ‚Äìb for 512 byte blocks, -c for bytes, or ‚Äìn for number of lines.
CHOWN: The chown command changes the user and/or group that owns a file. It normally
needs to be run as root using sudoeg. sudochownpi:root *filename* will change the owner to pi
and the group to root.
Conclusion: Hence we have successfully executed the ubuntu commands on raspbian OS.
